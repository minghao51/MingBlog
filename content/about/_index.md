> While data does not lie, it is easily manipulated, twisted and turned

This blog is dedicated to depict the bias often encoded in statistics, models, and visualization. **The objective is to explore the various plausible perspectives and interpretations available to certain data.** There is no denying that simple narrative, especially when it conforms to the individual bias and existing views, sell like hot cake. Fews are willing to consider alternate perspectives.  

The bias is probably exacerbated by today's fast-paced, short attention span culture, along with the abundance of mass media. Partitioning and fragmentation of countries, parties, and races are on a rampage. People are essentially equating confounding media to fake news.


_While I shall try to be objective with the data, some of the posts may still be opinioned (and thus biased), I will try to label them as such when appropriate._
